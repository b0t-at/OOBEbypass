# OOBE bypass b0t

From the OOBE Screen press Shift + F10

```
curl -L b0t.at/bypass -o skip.cmd
skip.cmd
```

This will skip the entire OOBE process including microsoft account and ANY questions during the setup process. It still allows you to select your language, region, and keyboard layout.

Admin and User do not have any password by default and auto login is enabled for "Admin".
